# PHP GUI Framework
This is an extension to gabrielrcouto/php-gui which adds a MVC like framework onto it.
Goto [https://github.com/kingga/php-gui-template](https://github.com/kingga/php-gui-template) for a boiler plate.

## NOTES
This may change a lot as it is in really early state of development.

## TODO
The renderer still needs a lot of work.
